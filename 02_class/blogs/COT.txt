Building a Thinking Model from a Non-Thinking Model Using Chain-of-Thought

Hey there everyone, this is Tushar, and in today’s blog, we’re going to unpack something super exciting—how you can take a “non-thinking” AI model and turn it into a “thinking” one using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

Sounds cool, right?
Let’s dive in.

Non-Thinking vs. Thinking Models

Before we get into the “how,” let’s understand the “what.”

A non-thinking model is like that friend who blurts out the first thing that comes to their mind. You ask a question, and boom—instant answer. Quick, but not always accurate.

A thinking model, on the other hand, is like your cautious friend who goes,
“Wait… let me think this through step-by-step,” and then gives you the answer. This usually means fewer mistakes and better reasoning.

Why Chain-of-Thought Is the Game Changer

In tech, there’s a saying: “Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.”
When an AI model takes the time to think, it’s more likely to give you accurate and logical answers.

Chain-of-Thought prompting is basically telling the AI:
“Don’t just answer—think out loud (step-by-step) before you answer.”

Turning a Non-Thinking Model into a Thinking One

So, how do you take a model that usually responds instantly and get it to “think” first?
Simple—you adjust the system prompt.

Here’s the basic idea:

Normally, you just give a direct question.

With CoT, you add an instruction to think through the problem step-by-step before giving the final output.

Example 1: Without Chain-of-Thought

Prompt: “What’s 27 × 43?”
Model: “1161” (Quick, but may be wrong if it guessed.)

Example 2: With Chain-of-Thought

System Prompt:

"You are an AI assistant that reasons step-by-step before answering. For every question, first break the problem into smaller steps, explain each step, and only then give the final answer."

User Prompt: “What’s 27 × 43?”
Model:
“Step 1: 27 × 40 = 1080
Step 2: 27 × 3 = 81
Step 3: 1080 + 81 = 1161
Final Answer: 1161 ✅”

The difference?
The model didn’t just spit out a number—it showed its work. This is critical for accuracy.

The CoT Formula for Building Thinking Models

Here’s a step-by-step way to implement CoT prompting:

Define the Role
Tell the model it’s a careful reasoner.
Example: “You are a logical thinker who solves problems step-by-step.”

Give Process Instructions
Ask it to think through the answer before speaking.
Example: “Do not give the final answer until all steps are shown.”

Force Sequential Thinking
In some cases, limit the output to one step per message so the model can’t jump to the conclusion.

Add Examples
Show how you expect the reasoning to look.
Example: “When solving math problems, break them down into sub-calculations.”

When to Use Chain-of-Thought

Math & Logic Problems
Prevents silly calculation mistakes.

Programming Debugging
The model can narrate its debugging approach.

Complex Planning
Works great for step-by-step strategies or project plans.

Multi-step Reasoning Questions
Anything that benefits from intermediate steps.

Pro Tip: Combine CoT with Few-Shot Prompting

Want an even smarter “thinking” model?
Give it examples of how you want the thought process to look.

Example system prompt:

"You are a step-by-step reasoning assistant. Follow this pattern:
Example:
Q: What’s the sum of the first 5 prime numbers?
Step 1: List the first 5 prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11
Step 2: Add them: 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 28
Final Answer: 28

Now follow the same process for all queries."

Final Thoughts

The difference between a non-thinking and a thinking model is like the difference between guessing and problem-solving.

By adding Chain-of-Thought prompting, you’re basically teaching the AI to slow down, reason, and arrive at more reliable answers.

So next time you want quality over speed, remember—don’t just ask the model to answer.
Ask it to think.

That’s it for today.
