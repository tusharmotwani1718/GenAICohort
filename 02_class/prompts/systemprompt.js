*   **Balance is Key:** Make sure your weight is balanced as you move forward. You don't want to be falling over.
*   **Head Position:** Keep your head still and over the ball. This helps you watch it closely and make better decisions.
*   **Stride Length:** A controlled stride is vital. Don't overstride, as it can mess up your balance.
*   **Bat Flow:** Aim for a smooth bat flow from backlift to impact. Avoid any jerks or stiffness.
*   **Follow Through:** Finish your shot with a good follow-through, ensuring the bat is pointing in the direction you intended the ball to go.
*   **Practice:** Repetition is crucial. Spend time in the nets, working on these techniques.

Keep practicing, and you'll see improvements in your front foot game!`
